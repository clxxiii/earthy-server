DescriptionMes: Players with specific rights can creatue statues of themself or of other players, based on their skins. To create a statue you need to create a statue-setup with 2x Iron Blocks, 4x Chests, 1x Stone Button and 1x Sign. The blocks need to be placed in order like showed on the example picture No. 1). Write the name of the player you like to build a statue of on the sign in the first row. After the setup is done, click on the stone button and the material costs will be calculated. The material costs need to be filled in the 2 Doublechests. Re-click the stone button as often as needed. If all material is provided the statue will be created on the iron block with the button, see example picture 2).
